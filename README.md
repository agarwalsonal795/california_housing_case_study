**Random Forest Regression: A Study on California Housing Prices**

**Abstract**

This study focuses on predicting California housing prices using machine learning 
techniques, with data sourced from Kaggle. We tested multiple regression models, 
including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Among 
these, Random Forest emerged as the most accurate, achieving a validation RÂ² score of 
0.83. Its strength lies in handling complex patterns, reducing overfitting, and effectively 
processing both numerical and categorical data. Through preprocessing, feature 
engineering, and tuning, we enhanced model performance, highlighting the value of 
machine learning in tackling real-world challenges. This research offers important 
insights for professionals in real estate, urban development, and policy-making, 
demonstrating how machine learning can effectively forecast housing prices and 
support informed decision-making.
